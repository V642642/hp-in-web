          <b>What are cookies, pixels/web beacon, and local storage?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Cookies are small files that the websites place on your computer as
          you browse the web. Like many websites, we use cookies to discover how
          people are using our services and to make them work better.
        </p>
        <p>
          A pixel (also known as web beacon) is a small amount of code on a web
          page or in an email notification. As many services do, we use pixels
          to learn whether you’ve interacted with certain web or email content.
          This helps us measure and improve our services and personalize your
          experience on the Website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Local storage is an industry-standard technology that allows a website
          or application to store information locally on your computer or mobile
          device. We use local storage to customize what we show you based on
          your past interactions with the Website.

          Two types of cookies may be used on the Website - &quot;session cookies&quot;
          and &quot;persistent cookies&quot;. Session cookies are temporary cookies that
          remain on your device until you leave the Website. A persistent cookie
          remains on your device for much longer or until you manually delete it
          (how long the cookie remains on your device will depend on the

          tags (also called clear gifs) that may be shared with third parties

          development. For example, website usage information about visitors of
